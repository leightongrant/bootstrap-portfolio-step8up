## Quick start

1. From the project root you can open `index.html` directly in a browser for a simple view. Note: since `assets/scripts/script.js` uses ES module imports, some browsers may block loading modules from the file system. To avoid that, serve the folder with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or, if you prefer Node and have http-server installed:

```bash
npx http-server -c-1 -p 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Development notes

-   Add or edit projects in `assets/scripts/data.js`. Each project object has the shape:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  image: './assets/images/project-1.webp',
  title: 'Project Title',
  text: 'Short description...',
  repo: 'https://github.com/your/repo',
  demo: 'https://your-demo-url'
}
```

-   `assets/scripts/script.js` imports the `projects` array and renders cards into the `.project-content` container.

## Project structure (high level)

-   index.html — main page
-   assets/
    -   css/ — `style.css` (and other CSS assets)
    -   images/ — webp images used by the site
    -   scripts/ — `data.js`, `script.js`
-   LICENSE — project license (MIT)
